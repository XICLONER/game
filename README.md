# Snake game
 Most of us know about **Snake game** and there is no need for explain it,
*but for others*, first of all I wonder how you don't know anything about it!
 The very first Snake-type game was an arcade game called Blockade.
It was created in **1976**. In this game you will be a snake!
And you just have 4 key for direct yourself to don't hit yourself or wall, and 
you can eat some items for grow and get longer.
